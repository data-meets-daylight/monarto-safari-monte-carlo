Dear Monarto Safari Park, 

I visited your park from interstate in January (2026) and had a wonderful day. Your staff and volunteers were fantastic, especially on a hot and very busy day. 

While using the Safari bus, I noticed something that seemed to affect visitor experience: at downstream stops, some visitor groups (especially larger families) were repeatedly unable to board because there were not enough seats available for their whole group. This created uneven waiting times, and I could see the frustration building.

I’m a final-year data science student at Curtin University, and I decided to put my skills to the test by building a computer simulation of your shuttle bus loop. The goal was to test whether a small change in boarding rules could reduce downstream wait issues and improve visitor experience without adding more buses.

What I modelled:
I compared two boarding approaches on simulated peak-attendance days:
1. Fill All Seats (current approach)
    Fill each bus to full capacity at the Visitor Centre whenever there is demand.
2. Reserve 5 Seats (proposed trial)  
    Leave 5 seats empty when departing the Visitor Centre so there is space available for visitors waiting at downstream stops.
    
This is a proof-of-concept model built from what I observed on the day, using best-guess inputs (assumptions). The main strength of the simulator is that it compares policies fairly. If the park provided real operating data, this model could be calibrated to better reflect reality and support decision-making.

What I found: 
Across the 1200 simulated days, the "Reserve 5 Seats" approach: 
1) Reduced the risk of visitors missing consecutive buses at downstream stops. 
2) Helped larger visitor groups the most, because they are the most likely to be blocked when buses are filled early.
3) Reduces downstream boarding failures across all stops, and makes it clearer which stops experience the highest downstream pressure on peak days.

I've included three plots below (and attached) to show you these results. These plots are just a visual summary of one message: holding a small number of seats at the first stop reduces downstream boarding issues on peak days, especially for larger groups.

Plot 1:

Notes for Plot 1 (Exceedance Curve): 
This shows, across 1,200 simulated peak days, how likely each policy is to produce a really severe ‘missed-bus’ day. The orange line sits further left, meaning extreme peak-day outcomes are less likely when 5 seats are held back at the Visitor Centre. 

Plot 2: 
![alt text](../Outputs/plot2-stacked-bar-chart.png)
Notes for Plot 2 (Stacked Bars): 
This zooms in on a bad peak day (95th percentile from the simulation set) and shows how many visitors miss 1–2, 3–4, or 5+ buses in a row, split by group size. Large groups are hit hardest when buses are filled at the first stop, and the reserved-seat policy improves all cases and almost eliminates the worst cases.

Plot 3: 
![alt text](../Outputs/plot3-radar.png)
Notes for Plot 3 (Radars): 
This shows where boarding problems occur by bus stop on a typical peak day (left) and a bad peak day (right). Further out means more visitors couldn’t board at that stop and allows for pinch points to be identified. The reserved-seat policy pulls the shape inward across stops, meaning fewer downstream boarding failures.

If you are interested, this model can be made much more accurate with Park and Shuttle Bus information. If Monarto is open to it - I would love to calibrate the model with real inputs and find the best seat policy for the park. 

Helpful information would include: 
1. Daily Attendance totals and visitor group sizes 
2. Visitor arrival and exit patterns to be matched to a distribution 
3. Number of buses and bus capacity in practice (usable seats)
4. Realistic bus travel time between stops and estimated exhibit visitor dwell times 
5. Bus rider departing behaviour at each stop (rough probabilities would be fine)
6. Cafe Stop churn at different times of day (rough probabilities would be fine)  


Thank you again for an excellent visit. If the park is interested, I’m happy to share the model, walk through the findings and discuss the additional information listed above that would help calibrate the simulation to your real operations.

Kind Regards,
